# Septante
## About the project
**Septante** is the place where my girlfriend and I are sharing photos of our different trips and rides.

## Objectives
* have a nice place to share our pictures
* practice my coding skills in _Javascript_ and _HTML-CSS_

## About the developer
I'm currently a student in computer sciences and this project is the first not related to school or work.

## Design
Before coding the website I made a design using _adobe xd_ just. The main reason is that to have a guide line to follow duri.
